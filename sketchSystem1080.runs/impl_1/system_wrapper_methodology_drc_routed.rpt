There is a large setup violation of -7.919 ns between system_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/ENABLE_AXIS_SKID.I_MM2S_SKID_BUF/sig_data_reg_out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/SketchIP_1080p_0/inst/IC/lB1/line_reg_r3_704_767_0_2/RAMB/I (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
